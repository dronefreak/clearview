### Contributing Code

#### Good First Issues

Look for issues labeled `good first issue` if you're new to the project. These are typically:

- Documentation improvements
- Simple bug fixes
- Adding tests for existing functionality
- Code cleanup and refactoring

#### Areas That Need Help

- **New architectures**: Implement Transformer-based or diffusion models
- **Optimization**: Improve inference speed, reduce memory usage
- **Documentation**: Tutorials, examples, API docs
- **Testing**: Increase test coverage
- **Datasets**: Add support for new datasets
- **Deployment**: Docker, TensorRT, ONNX optimizations

## Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearview.git
cd clearview
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
# Using venv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Or using conda
conda create -n deraining python=3.10
conda activate deraining
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install package in editable mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Or manually:
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### 4. Verify Installation

```bash
# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Check code formatting
black --check src/ scripts/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy src/
```

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# Or for bug fixes:
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

Branch naming conventions:

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding or updating tests

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clear, commented code
- Follow the coding standards (see below)
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_models.py

# Check code coverage
pytest --cov=src/deraining tests/

# Test formatting
black --check .
isort --check .

# Type checking
mypy src/
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add attention mechanism to U-Net"
# See commit message guidelines below
```

### 5. Push and Create PR

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:

- **Clear title** describing the change
- **Description** of what changed and why
- **Link to related issues** (e.g., "Closes #123")
- **Screenshots/examples** if relevant
- **Checklist** confirming you've tested and documented

**PR Template:**

```markdown
## Description

Brief description of changes.

## Related Issues

Closes #(issue number)

## Type of Change

- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change
- [ ] Documentation update

## Testing

- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Added new tests for new features
- [ ] Updated documentation

## Screenshots (if applicable)

```

### 6. Code Review

- Be open to feedback and discussion
- Make requested changes promptly
- Keep the PR focused on a single change
- Update your branch if main has changed: `git rebase main`

## Coding Standards

### Python Style

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

```python
# Use black for formatting (line length: 88)
black src/ scripts/ tests/

# Use isort for import sorting
isort src/ scripts/ tests/

# Type hints for all functions
def train_model(
    model: nn.Module,
    data_loader: DataLoader,
    epochs: int = 100
) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Train the deraining model.

    Args:
        model: PyTorch model to train
        data_loader: DataLoader for training data
        epochs: Number of training epochs

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing training metrics
    """
    pass
```

### Code Organization

```python
# Order of imports:
# 1. Standard library
import os
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict, Optional

# 2. Third-party
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import numpy as np

# 3. Local
from clearview.models import UNet
from clearview.losses import CombinedLoss
```

### Documentation

- **Docstrings**: Use Google style docstrings
- **Comments**: Explain _why_, not _what_
- **Type hints**: Required for all public functions
- **README updates**: Update if adding features

Example docstring:

```python
def preprocess_image(
    image: np.ndarray,
    target_size: Tuple[int, int] = (512, 384),
    normalize: bool = True
) -> torch.Tensor:
    """Preprocess image for model input.

    Resizes, normalizes, and converts image to PyTorch tensor.

    Args:
        image: Input image as numpy array (H, W, C)
        target_size: Target (height, width) for resizing
        normalize: Whether to normalize to [0, 1] range

    Returns:
        Preprocessed image tensor (C, H, W)

    Raises:
        ValueError: If image shape is invalid

    Example:
        >>> img = cv2.imread('rainy.jpg')
        >>> tensor = preprocess_image(img, target_size=(384, 512))
        >>> print(tensor.shape)
        torch.Size([3, 384, 512])
    """
    pass
```

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Use pytest fixtures for common setup
- Test edge cases and error conditions

```python
# tests/test_models.py
import pytest
import torch
from clearview.models import UNet

def test_unet_forward_pass():
    """Test U-Net forward pass with various input sizes."""
    model = UNet(in_channels=3, out_channels=3)

    # Test multiple resolutions
    for size in [(256, 256), (512, 384), (1024, 768)]:
        x = torch.randn(2, 3, *size)
        y = model(x)
        assert y.shape == x.shape, f"Output shape mismatch for {size}"

def test_unet_invalid_input():
    """Test U-Net handles invalid inputs gracefully."""
    model = UNet(in_channels=3, out_channels=3)

    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        # Should fail with wrong number of channels
        x = torch.randn(2, 4, 256, 256)
        model(x)
```
